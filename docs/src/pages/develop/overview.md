## Source Code

The source code of the project is completely **open-source** and open for anyone use &  improve. It's a monorepo, hosted on github [here!](https://github.com/sudhamjayanthi/smart-identities)

It can divided into four main parts :

1. [Smart Contracts](/develop/contracts)
2. [Frontend](/develop/frontend)
3. [Subgraph](/develop/subgraph)
4. Documentation (source of this site)

## Contributing

Feel free to open a issue / pull request if you find any bugs or have feature suggestions. 

You can also use the existing contracts and build new protocols on top of it. Or well, you might even completely fork the repo and build your own version of it!

Everything is open-sourced, permisionless, decentralised & composable. I'll be more than excited to see people building on top of this :)
